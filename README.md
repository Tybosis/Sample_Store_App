# Sample Store App

By Tyler Pottle

## Description
This is a basic store app that I created to test out using the Zurb's Foundation
front end framework.  This project shows how you can use prebuilt css styles to
customize the look and feel of an app much quicker that writing all the css
yourself.  So far I have mainly worked on the style of the products page and
adding a new product, but in the future I plan to style the rest of the app
and explore more of what Foundation has to offer.

### Sources

The idea for this project came from the Railscast video series, Episode #417:
[Foundation](http://railscasts.com/episodes/417-foundation)

The color scheme for this app was created by using the [Lavish Color Generator](http://tinyurl.com/pjl8lg8)
